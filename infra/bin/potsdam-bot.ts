 * include testing to deploy the app from a staging environment to a production environment
 * actually the pipeline should react to changes on the branch 'dev'
 * and push changes to the branch 'main' whenever everything is okay, and whenever it is not,
 * it should create an issue including the CloudWatch logs trail.
 * A push to 'main' should then trigger a deployment to the production system.
